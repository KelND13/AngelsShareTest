The first view allows the user to search an external database of whiskeys. 
From that list the user can label a whiskey as 'thumbs up,' 'thumbs down', or 'flag' (for those they haven't tried yet)
If user has already tried and/or labeled a whiskey from the main search list, that label will show up in the search results. You can also save a whiskey to your favorites list displayed in another tab.
