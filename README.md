The first view allows the user to search an external database of whiskeys. 
From that list the user can label a whiskey as 'thumbs up,' 'thumbs down', or 'flag' (for those they haven't tried yet)
If user has already tried and/or labeled a whiskey from the main search list, that label will show up in the search results

The second view displays a Google Maps API for finding nearby whiskey places

The third view displays 'thumbs up,' or favorited, whiskeys (This may change in future iterations)

Onboarding: Asks for email address and password - authenticated with Firebase

Dependencies:
The app relies on Google Maps API, a Firebase database, and cocoa pods (for Google Maps and Firebase)
